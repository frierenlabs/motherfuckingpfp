        <h1>Anime PFPs are Fucking Perfect</h1>
        <aside>And it's fucking true.</aside>

    <h2>Welcome to my fucking website about anime profile pictures (pfp)</h2>

    <p>You probably see people with anime profile pictures and think their shit is weird. You think they're trying too
        hard to be "quirky" or "cute". Wrong, motherfucker. Let me describe why anime PFPs are the perfect fucking
        profile pictures:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Shit's unique and stands out from all the shitty selfies and generic photos</li>
        <li>The motherfucker's timeless and will always be fucking perfect, unlike your shitty selfies that'll become
            outdated and embarrassing in a few years.</li>
        <li>No matter how many times you change your motherfucking anime PFP, you'll always have a motherfucking perfect
            option to choose from.</li>
        <li>It's fucking expressive and can convey your mood and personality better than any shitty selfie or generic
            photo.</li>
        <li>Your motherfucking anime PFP is a motherfucking work of art, not some shitty snapshot taken with a
            motherfucking phone camera.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Well guess what, motherfucker:</h2>

    <p>You. Are. Judging. Look at this shit. It's a motherfucking anime profile picture. Why the fuck do you need to
        make fun of someone for their interests? You spent hours scrolling through Instagram looking for the perfect
        filter for your shitty selfie, but some motherfucker with an anime PFP gets all the attention. Not to mention
        you don't know shit about anime, but you don't see any of your shitty shit.</p>

    <p>You never knew it, but Anime PFPs are fucking perfect. Here's why.</p>

    <h2>They're fucking unique</h2>

    <p>This entire profile picture stands out from all the generic selfies and photos on social media. Did you seriously
        think people want to see your face in every fucking photo? You're not that special, motherfucker.</p>

    <h2>They're based</h2>

    <p>You dumbass. You thought you needed to conform to society's standards of what a profile picture should look like,
        but no. Your profile picture should represent you and your fucking obsessions. Anime PFPs are a perfect way to show that
        you're into anime and connect with others who don't give a flying fuck what a grifters are doing.</p>

    <h2>They fucking work</h2>

    <p>Look at this shit. You can see it ... that is, if you're not blind, motherfucker. It makes sense. It has
        motherfucking character. That's personality, motherfucker.</p>

    <p>It shows off your alter ego, waifu, anime tastebuds. Your profile picture shows off your face and nothing else.
        You're boring, motherfucker.</p>

    <p>Cross-platform compatibility? Upload this motherfucker on any social media platform. I fucking dare you.</p>

    <h2>This is an anime PFP. Look at it. You've never seen one before.</h2>

    <p>Like the man who's never watched anime has no idea what he's missing, you have no fucking idea what an anime PFP
        can do for you. All you have ever seen are boring,
       
    <hr>

    <h2>Epilogue</h2>
    <p>From the philosophies expressed (poorly) above, <a href="http://txti.es">txti</a> was created. You should try it
        today to make your own motherfucking pfp.</p>

    <h3>Yes, this is fucking satire, you fuck</h3>

    <p>I'm not actually saying your shitty pfp should look like this. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have
        with pfp are <strong>ones we create ourselves</strong>. Pfp aren't broken by default, they are
        functional, high-performing, and accessible. You overthink them. You son-of-a-bitch.</p>
